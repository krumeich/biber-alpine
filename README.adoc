= Building biber under Alpine Linux

The TeX Live distribution does not provide biber for MUSL based Linux distros
such as Alpine.

This project provides the means to build biber under Alpine Linux from the
source. Run

----
docker build -t krumeich/biber-alpine .
----

to build the image. This takes some time, as all the perl dependencies are
downloaded and installed. Then run

----
docker run -v $PWD:/opt krumeich/biber-alpine
----

to build the biber binary. Mounting the `$PWD` as `/opt` make the
directory visible in which the build process installs the binary

== Notes

* As of Feb 2019 Alpine bundles OpenSSL 1.1.1, which defaults to TLS 1.3. The
  Perl library Net::SSLEay on CPAN is version 1.8.5, which does not support this
  version of OpenSSL. For the time being, we manually install an updated version
  of Net::SSLeay (1.8.6_07), to be removed once the patches have made it into
  the distribution.
