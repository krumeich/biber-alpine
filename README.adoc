= Building biber under Alpine Linux

The TeX Live distribution does not provide biber for MUSL based Linux distros
such as Alpine.

== Building

This project provides the means to build and test biber under Alpine Linux from the
source. Run

----
docker build -t krumeich/biber-alpine .
----

to build the image. This takes some time, as all the perl dependencies are
downloaded and installed. Then run

----
docker run -v $PWD:/opt krumeich/biber-alpine
----

to build the biber binary. Mounting the `$PWD` as `/opt` makes the
directory visible in which the build process installs the packed binary.

== Testing

To test the build the binary should be run in an environment that does not
contain the build infrastructure, such as Perl and all the required
libraries. This project also provides a test environment. Run

----
docker build -f Dockerfile.test --tag krumeich/biber-test .
----

to build the image for the test environment. Then run

----
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/usr/local/bin krumeich/biber-test
----

to run simple tests to validate the build. Again, the current directory is mounted
into the container to access the binary which as been produced in the previous
steps.

== Notes

* Passing `-e branch=<branchname>` causes the branch `<branchname>` to be
  built. If the parameter is omitted, `branch` will default to `dev`:
+
----
docker run -v $PWD:/usr/local/bin -e branch=krumeich/musl krumeich/biber-alpine
---- 

* Passing `-e repo=<reponame>` causes the repository `<reponame>` to be
  built. If the parameter is omitted, `repo` will default to `plk/biber`:
+
----
docker run -v $PWD:/usr/local/bin -e repo=krumeich/biber krumeich/biber-alpine
----

Of course you can combine both variants to build an arbitrary branch from an
arbitrary biber fork.

==   Building and Testing with make

* Alternatively, if you have `make` installed, use `make image` to create the
  image, then use `make biber` to build biber. To pass a particular branch name,
  set the environment variables `BRANCH` and/or `REPO` on the same command line:
+   
----
BRANCH=krumeich/musl REPO=krumeich/biber make biber
----

* Consequently, run `make test` to build the test environment and run the validation.

* If you are completely lazy, then just run `make all` to build all images, the
  biber binary and run the test in one go.
