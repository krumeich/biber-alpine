= Building biber under Alpine Linux

The TeX Live dsitribution does not provide biber for MUSL based Linux distros such as Alpine.

This project provides the means to build biber under Alpine Linux from the source. Run

----
docker build -t krumeich/biber-alpine .
----

to build the image. This takes some time, as all the perl dependencies are
downloaded and installed. Then run

----
docker run -v $PWD:/usr/local/bin krumeich/biber-alpine
----

to build the biber binary. Mounting the `$PWD` as `/usr/local/bin` make the
directory visible in which the build process installs the binary
